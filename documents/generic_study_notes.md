  32 and 64 bit machines

  * A 32 bit machine and process 32-digit binary number at a time. 
  * 1 digit binary can present up to 1, decimal: 1, 2^1-1, 2 digit binary can present up to 11, decimal: 3, 2^2-1 3 digit binary can present up to 111, decimal: 7
  * 32 bit machine use one bti to store sign, therefore, it can process up to 31 digit a time, therefore 2^31-1 = 2147483647. The largest signed integer for 32 bit machine is 2147483647. Simiarly, the largest integer for 64 bit machine is 2^63-1 = 9223372036854775807.
